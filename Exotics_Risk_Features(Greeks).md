| Product | Dominant Risks | Why | Math derivation (core idea) |
|--------|----------------|-----|-----------------------------|
| **Barrier** | Delta, Gamma, Vega, Barrier proximity risk | Value highly sensitive to spot vs trigger; crossing probability depends on volatility | Barrier price depends on hitting probability:  \n\( V = E[ \mathbf{1}_{\tau_B > T}(S_T-K)^+ ] \).  \nGreeks involve derivatives of hitting probability \(P(\tau_B)\) w.r.t. spot and vol → large delta/gamma near barrier. |
| **Asian (Arithmetic)** | Delta (reduced), Gamma (reduced), Vega (term-structure), Averaging window risk | Averaging smooths spot risk but introduces sensitivity to volatility during averaging window | Payoff uses running average:  \n\( A_T=\frac{1}{n}\sum S_{t_i} \),  \n\( V=E[(A_T-K)^+] \).  \nVariance of \(A_T\) < variance of \(S_T\) → reduced delta/gamma; dependence on distribution of \(A_T\) creates forward-vega exposure. |
| **Bermudan** | Vega, Exercise boundary risk, Curve risk, Smile/model risk | Early exercise depends on continuation value and forward curve | Optimal stopping problem:  \n\( V(t)=\max(\text{exercise}, E[V(t+\Delta t)|\mathcal F_t]) \).  \nGreeks depend on continuation value → sensitivity to vol, curve, and model used for conditional expectation. |
| **Cliquet** | Vega, Forward vega, Volga, Vanna, Realized vol risk | Payoff accumulates capped returns → strong volatility-path sensitivity | Period payoff:  \n\( C_i=\min(\max(R_i,L),U) \),  \nTotal payoff \( V=E[\sum C_i] \).  \nEach term behaves like forward-start option → sum of vegas + sensitivity to future vol distribution → volga/vanna exposure. |
